# IndependentSetGym
Applying reinforcement learning and game theoretic techniques to find the maximum independent set in a graph. I most extensively use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Algorithm
to do so. It is a policy gradient algorithm developed by OpenAI and is very powerful as well as easily adaptable and tunable.
